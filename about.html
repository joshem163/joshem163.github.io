        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
           I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the <b>University of Dhaka<b>, where I also served as a lecturer before pursuing my Ph.D. My research journey began in environmental modeling, with two publications on thunderstorm and cyclone forecasting.
            Today, my focus has evolved to include topological methods and their applications in graph-based machine learning, with a vision to continue contributing to academia and research post-Ph.D.

I invite you to explore my work and publications on this site. If you’re interested in <b>collaborations<b>, <b>research discussions<b>, or <b>speaking engagements<b>, please feel free to reach out via the contact page.
