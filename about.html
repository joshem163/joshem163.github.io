        <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at UT Dallas, specializing in  Numerical Modeling and  Topological Machine Learning on graphs, with a focus on power grid networks.
           . My research aims to improve graph representation learning through topological encodings. In my current research, I focus on integrating topological data analysis (TDA) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to address limitations in existing graph representation learning.
            I developed two novel models, Wise-GNN and ClassContrast, which address fundamental challenges faced by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). My research also addresses one of the most critical issues facing the world todayâ€”securing and improving the resilience of the national power grid.
